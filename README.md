# Nobel Prize Winners Data Analysis with Python

This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Nobel Prize Winners dataset using Python.

The goal is to discover patterns and insights related to Nobel laureates over the years, focusing on gender distribution, countries, and award categories.

---

## Key Areas Explored

- Gender distribution among Nobel laureates  
- Country-wise winner counts  
- Popular award categories  
- Trends over time (years, frequency, diversity)

---

## Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**  
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** â€“ for data manipulation  
- **Jupyter Notebook** â€“ for analysis and documentation  
- *(Note: All visualizations were created within the notebook environment)*

## Project Purpose

This project was created to improve my skills in data analysis using Python, particularly with real-world datasets.  
It helped me practice data wrangling, grouping, aggregation, and identifying patterns without external visualization tools â€“ all within Jupyter Notebook.
